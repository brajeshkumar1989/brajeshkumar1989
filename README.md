- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ## Brajesh Kumar, 
- ðŸ‘€ I have created a Monitoring tool that monitors WebLogic Servers (40 servers) and defined automated actions like heap memory clearing etc.
- I have written a full stack end-to-end monitoring application, where servers events I am capturing using $\mathbf {PowerShell}$ scripts and then controlling data flows using $\mathbf {ExpressJS}$ (for APIs) and then using $\mathbf {ReactJS}$ for UI UX.
- For styling I use $\mathbf {SASS}$ , $\mathbf {Bootstrap}$ , $\mathbf {Styled Components}$ , $\mathbf {Tailwind CSS}$ 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and deep learning with Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics.
